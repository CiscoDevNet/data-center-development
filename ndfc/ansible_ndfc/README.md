# Ansible and Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC)

## Overview 

This section details how to use Ansible to configure and interact with a NDFC.

> Note: NDFC has evolved fron Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)

<br>

## Environment Setup

You'll want to clone the main repo (if you haven't already done so) and change directories to this point. Then create and activate a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies.

The instructions on how to perform all of the above can be found on the README.md in the root of this repo: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-center-development/tree/main

<br>

## Insfrastructure 

As discussed in the [NDFC landing page](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-center-development/edit/main/ndfc) in this repo (this is a child directory of it), we will be using the [vNexus Dashboard Fabric Controller sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/DevNet/catalog/vnexus-dashboard-fabric-controller_vnexus-dashboard-fabric-controller) provided by Cisco DevNet, but you are free to use other option.
