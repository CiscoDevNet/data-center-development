# Ansible and Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC)

## Overview 

This section details how to use Ansible to configure and interact with a NDFC.

> Note: NDFC has evolved fron Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)

## Environment Setup

You'll want to clone the main repo (if you haven't already done so) and change directories to this point. Then create and activate a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies.

The instructions on how to perform all of the above can be found on the README.md in the root of this repo: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-center-development/tree/main

### Export the Username and Password of your NX-OS device (for CML, its admin/cisco)

```bash
export NXOS_User=
export NXOS_Password=
```
