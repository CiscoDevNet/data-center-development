## Documentation

Always start with the documentation ; )

The REST API Docs for NDFC can be found at the /apidocs/ endpoint of the NDFC Controller. For DevNet's NDFc Sandbox, that would be currently be https://10.10.20.60/apidocs/

At the top left, you can toggle between the docs for Nexus Dashboard and Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller.

Also, the latest documentation for NDFC API reference is here:

- [NDFC API Reference LAN](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nexus-dashboard-fabric-controller/latest/api-reference-lan/)
- [NDFC API Reference SAN](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nexus-dashboard-fabric-controller/latest/api-reference-san/)


Currently, the easiest way to interact with NDFC using REST APIs is via the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) app.

If you choose to go that route, you can follow the [NDFC REST Postman Learning Lab from Cisco DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/ndfc-programmability/ndfc_rest_postman_llab/introduction/)

We're not going to use Postman, but we are going to use the NDFC Sandbox from DevNet, which the Postman lab also uses.

*Actually, the code generated here was created by using Postman to convert the Postman API calls to Python with the 'Code' tab*
