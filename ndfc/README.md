## Overview 

For ACI, we will be utilizing the *Reservable* [vNexus Dashboard Fabric Controller](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/DevNet/catalog/vnexus-dashboard-fabric-controller_vnexus-dashboard-fabric-controller) from Cisco DevNet. 

Here is the infrastructure of the sandbox:

## Prerequisites

- You should have an enviornment with NDFC running. This could be a physical setup with NDFC a DevNet sandbox, or something similar from Cisco dCloud.
- An IDE (e.g. VS Code)

<br>

## Lab Setup

Follow the instructions in your documentation. For the NDFC sandbox from DevNet, the [instructions](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/DevNet/catalog/vnexus-dashboard-fabric-controller_vnexus-dashboard-fabric-controller) are very clear and will guide you in ensuring the controller, cluster, fabrics, etc. are up and running properly.

## Next Steps

Once you've stablished connectivity with your functioning NDFC cluster, you can proceed to the labs in this directory.
